Starting point for a Docker Web Server
======================================
* A proxy which routes between installed nginx containers
* Logspout which logs to papertrail

Development machine setup
-------------------------

For development on OSX and Windows I recommend you install Kinematic: https://kitematic.com/

Once Kitematic is installed then 'Install Docker Commands' from the Kitematic menu. This installs the docker command line utilities.


Production server setup
-----------------------
1. Install Docker
  - https://docs.docker.com/installation/

2. Install Docker Compose:
  - https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

3. Clone the Docker Web Server
